These are packages that I often use or, alternatively, I need only rarely but don't want to forget about. Of course, there are many other useful packages out there (e.g. at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) or [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=package&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=R).
