### My directory of R packages for Ecology, Biogeography and Evolution, plus statistical modelling and visualisation

[F. Rodriguez-Sanchez](http://bit.ly/frod_san)

These are packages that I often use or, alternatively, I need only rarely but don't want to forget about. Of course, there are many other useful packages out there (e.g. at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) or [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=package&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=R)). Check also [CRAN task views](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).

Browse the directory [here](https://github.com/Pakillo/Rpackages_dir/blob/master/Rpkg_dir.md).
